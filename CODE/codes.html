							<h4>Common Bottlenose Dolphin</h4>
							<div class="wel1">
								<img src="a.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/>
							</div>
							<p>Coastal populations of common bottlenose dolphins are more territorial and utilize a larger number of coastal habitats – from bays and estuaries to seagrass beds, beaches, and other ecosystems. Oceanic populations are more migratory in nature and apparently do not visit coastal ecosystems.

Common bottlenose dolphins can be quite large, reaching weights of up to 1400 pounds (~640 kg) and lengths of 12.5 feet (~4 m). They are relatively long-lived (40-50 years) and reach sexual maturity at ages between 5 and 14 years old. Some individuals are known to be reproductively active for their entire lives, a rare characteristic among mammals. Like all mammals, common bottlenose dolphins reproduce through internal fertilization, and females give birth to live young. Juveniles are able to swim from the moment they are born, but they are totally dependent on nursing their mothers’ milk for nearly two years.</p>

							<h4>Blue whales</h4>
							<div class="wel1">
								<img src="C2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/>
							</div>
							<p>Interestingly, though they are enormous, blue whales are not predatory. They filter feed for tiny krill and are totally harmless to people (other than through accidental collisions). This life history strategy is common among several large animals in the ocean, including the whale shark, the basking shark, and the other great whales. Like all whales, blue whales are mammals and give live birth to very large calves that they nurse for six or seven months. Because the female is responsible for providing milk for its babies, she must store extra energy reserves and is consequentially larger than males. All of the record blue whales (by size) are females. Males do not provide parental care and do not seem to live near the females/young for most of the year.</p>

							<h4>American lobster</h4>
							<div class="wel1">
								<img src="C1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt=""/>
							</div>
							<p>The American lobster reaches weights of at least 45 pounds (20 kg), and is the largest crustacean in the world by weight. Along with true crabs, prawns, and other lobsters, the American lobster is a decapod; it has ten legs, and it is covered with a spiny exoskeleton that provides it some protection from potential predators. Most American Lobsters are rusty brown in coloration, but a wide variety of strange colors/patterns have been rarely observed by fishers and scientists. These include individuals that are bright blue, green, mottled, and even some that are perfectly divided down the middle with different colors on each side (e.g., half blue, half black; half black, half red; etc.).</p>
